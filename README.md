# Language Translator App
An interactive application built with Python.

## About
This is an interactive Python app that translates English words into Spanish and French.  

Users can enter an English word and the app will provide the Spanish and French translations of that word.     

## Project Background
The Language Translator app was built as part of the coursework for the "Getting Started with Python" course by Skillcrush. 

The skills practiced during this project include: 

- Modules: Importing and using the external CSV module to work with a CSV file containing data in the form of English, Spanish, and French words.  

- Reading and accessing CSV file contents: Opening CSV files and using DictReader() to convert a CSV file into a Python dictionary to allow Python to read the file contents. Writing code to search in and access hundreds of lines of CSV data.   

## Built With
- Python
- CSV module
